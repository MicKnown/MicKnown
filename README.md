## 🔥 The Short Version

I'm **Mic Known**—but everywhere I go, people call me **BossMan**.

I pioneered **RAP Funnels** with LifePreneur Music — cinematic campaigns for **ClickFunnels, GoHighLevel, Fullstaq Marketer, HempWorx, InVideo, and Photobooth International**. I reverse-engineered what actually converts, then I systematized it.

Now I build AI-powered CRM systems, automated lead generation funnels, and custom cloud software that scales.

**From the studio to the server room.** I architect scalable AI systems by day and create chart-worthy music by night. With over **$200K+ in streaming royalties** earned and **enterprise-grade infrastructure** deployed, I bridge the gap between **creative expression** and **technical execution**.

> *"I reverse-engineer what converts, then I systematize it."*

## 🎬 RAP Funnels & LifePreneur Music

## 🎯 Philosophy

<div align="center">

> **"I reverse-engineer what converts, then I systematize it."**
>
> **"Every beat needs a system. Every system needs a soul."**
>
> **"I don't just build systems—I compose them. I don't just write code—I write hits."**

</div>

**My Approach:**
- 🎵 **Music Informs Code**: Rhythm, timing, and flow principles guide system architecture
- 🏗️ **Code Amplifies Creativity**: Technical skills multiply artistic output and reach
- 💼 **Art + Tech = Scalable Business**: Sustainable ventures at the intersection of both worlds
- ⚡ **Precision & Passion**: Every line of code, every beat, crafted with purpose
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family First**: Building systems that create time and financial freedom
